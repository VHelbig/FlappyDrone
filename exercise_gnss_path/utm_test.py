This file contains a simple Python script to test the UTM conversion class.

Revision
2013-04-05 KJ First version
2015-03-09 KJ Minor update of the license text.
2016-01-16 KJ Corrected a minor problem with the library location reference.
2020-02-03 KJ Python 3 compatible, changed functionality: it now moves a
              geodetic position 100 meter East
2020-09-17 KJ Changed first line to python3
